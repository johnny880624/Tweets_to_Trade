# Tweet Sentiment Analysis for Stock Price Trends

Curious about the financial drivers behind stock investments, this project explores whether tweet sentiment can predict stock price trends. Using sentiment analysis on tweets tied to specific stocks, we categorize remarks from the past five trading days and analyze their correlation with next-day price movements. While our findings suggest limited short-term predictive power, this prototype offers a foundation for companies to tap into social platforms, uncover investor perceptions, and refine their offerings based on customer sentiment.

## Project Objective

The goal is to harness sentiment analysis on historical tweet data alongside stock price records. By classifying tweets into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and examining their relationship with price fluctuations, we aim to provide insights into how social media chatter reflects—or influences—market behavior.
